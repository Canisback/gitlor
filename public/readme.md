This is the front-end part.

It relies on React and Webpack.

To prepare the project : 
```
npm install
```

For developing and having the project bundled at every change, run the command 
```
npm run create
```

The application part is in the `app` directory, the `Constants.js` file contains URLs for the project, like backend url and images url.
