This is the back-end part of this project.

It relies on NodeJS and MongoDB, as well as nodemon for dev.

To prepare the project : 
```
npm install
```

For developing and having the project compiled at every change, run the command 
```
npm start
```

The source files are in the `src` folder, the front-end part is in the `public` folder.


Most of the back-end code is ready, we didn't achieve to finish the front-end in time.



### Motivations

An online deck builder is good, but it sometimes lack some things as getting an out of date deck can be bad to play with, or the good deck you found just changed and you prefered the last version but you can't find it anymore. Creating a version control tools for deck is a solution for that type of problems and this is the goal of this project.
